SFCAL Readme

This program removes extra calendar events from an ics calendar file.

The data for the calendar is calculated with Solar Fire 8 on Windows XP.  It is run through the Perl script, then the Word macros.  Ideally that would all take place in one Java executable - but that's a project for the future.

This little program is the final step in preparing the SFCAL.ics file for uploading in Google or another calendar system.
