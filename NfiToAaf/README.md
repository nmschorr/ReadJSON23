Program Name: NfiToAaf

Author:  Nancy Schorr

Design concept:  Axel Becker

Date: June 1, 2016 

Runs on Windows 7 64-bit only. 

Unzip the zip file to anywhere you like.

It creates a folder called "dist".

Inside "dist" is a file called "nfitoaaf.exe".

Double click on nfitoaaf.exe to run it.

This program translates "nfi" files into "aaf" files.


You MUST put the nfi files to be converted into:  'C:\astin'    

The results will show up in 'C:\astout'. This is where you are sorting to, and it's created for you if it's not there.

The files will be in a subfolder that is named with the timestamp of the time it's created. You can re-run over and over without worrying about overwriting past files because each timestamp will be unique.
