Runs on Windows 7 64-bit only. 

Unzip the zip file to anywhere you like.

It creates a folder called "dist".

Inside "dist" is a file called "astfiles.exe".

Double click on astfiles.exe to run it.

This program translates "nfi"-files into aaf files.


You MUST put the nfi files to be converted into:  C:\\astin'    

The results will show up in 'C:\\astout'. This is where you are sorting to, and it's created for you if it's not there.
