ICSfilePrep Readme

This project takes ics calendar output from Solar Fire and reformats it to correct mistakes and to view more productively.

The data for the calendar is calculated with Solar Fire 8 on Windows XP.  It is run through the Perl script, then the Word macros.  Ideally that would all take place in one Java executable - but that's a project for the future.

Once imported into a Google Calendar - For this calendar to display with the correct times, you must have your Google time zone settings set correctly.  It's possible they are already set correctly by default. To check, see this page:

To add this calendar to your own Google calendar and Android: 

    1.    You must have a google account and be logged in.  Go to http://www.google.com/calendar/
           Click the down-arrow next to Other calendars in the left column
    2.    Select Add by URL from the menu     
    3.    Enter this ical address in the field provided:
http://www.google.com/calendar/ical/qf8vj00k7jm0o7kmpu4e6b06dk%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic.ics
        
    4.    Click the Add Calendar button. The calendar will appear in the Other Calendars section of the calendar list to the left.  The events in the calendar will appear on your android - assuming you are using the same Google login account on it.

If you find your Android Calendar app has duplicate entries, or other weird problems, you can reset it by unlinking to the main Transit Calendar.  Then clear the cache like this:
Go to Settings > Applications > Manage applications
Press the menu button and choose "filter"
Select "ALL"
Go to "Calendar Storage" click on it
Press "Clear data"

This should delete all the calendar data on your device.  Now relink to the Transit calendar.
